AliBaba is a simple mobile application that allows users to buy tickets online for different types of transportation: trains, buses and flights (domestic and international, one-way or round-trip).

To reserve a ticket, users can simply create an account, search between thousands of tickets, and choose the one that best suits their needs.

Companies can also have an account (separate from those of users) and add, edit or remove tickets. They can also see their sales analysis for the last months and the last year.

In the following, you will see photos of the purchase process and the process of adding tickets by the seller:
